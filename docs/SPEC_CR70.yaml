title: >
  Increase size and touch area of edit and delete icons in the actor list

description: >
  The edit (✎) and delete (✖) icons in the ActorSelector component are too small,
  making them difficult to tap on mobile devices. The request is to increase both
  the visual size (fontSize) and the occupied space (padding, gap, hitSlop) of
  these action icons to improve usability and touch target compliance.

scope:
  in:
    - "Increase the fontSize of the edit and delete action icons"
    - "Increase the padding around each icon to enlarge the touch target"
    - "Increase the gap between the edit and delete icons"
    - "Increase the hitSlop on the Pressable wrappers for better touch detection"
  out:
    - "Changing the icon glyphs themselves (keep ✎ and ✖)"
    - "Changing icon colors or any other visual styling beyond size/spacing"
    - "Changing the layout of the actor row (name area, row height, etc.)"
    - "Changes to the actor CRUD logic or any other business logic"
    - "Changes to any screen or component other than ActorSelector"

acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-1
    given: "The ActorSelector bottom sheet with a list of actors"
    when: "The user views an actor row"
    then: >
      The edit and delete icons are visually larger than the current 24px fontSize.
      The new fontSize should be 28px.
    priority: must

  - id: AC-2
    given: "The ActorSelector bottom sheet with a list of actors"
    when: "The user views the action icons area"
    then: >
      The padding around each icon is increased from 4px to 8px, making each
      icon occupy more screen space and providing a larger touch target.
    priority: must

  - id: AC-3
    given: "The ActorSelector bottom sheet with a list of actors"
    when: "The user views the edit and delete icons side by side"
    then: >
      The gap between the two icons is increased from 20px to 28px, providing
      clearer visual separation and reducing accidental mis-taps.
    priority: must

  - id: AC-4
    given: "The Pressable wrappers around each icon"
    when: "The user taps near (but not exactly on) an icon"
    then: >
      The hitSlop is increased from 12px to 16px, extending the touchable area
      beyond the visible icon bounds for easier tapping.
    priority: must

  - id: AC-5
    given: "The ActorSelector after the icon size changes"
    when: "The user views the actor list"
    then: >
      The overall layout remains visually balanced. The actor name still has
      flex: 1 and truncates with numberOfLines={1} if needed. The icons do not
      overflow or clip.
    priority: must

  - id: AC-6
    given: "The ActorSelector after the icon size changes"
    when: "The user taps the edit icon"
    then: "The edit inline input appears as before (no functional regression)"
    priority: must

  - id: AC-7
    given: "The ActorSelector after the icon size changes"
    when: "The user taps the delete icon"
    then: "The delete confirmation Alert appears as before (no functional regression)"
    priority: must

edge_cases:
  - id: EC-1
    case: "Actor name is very long, pushing icons to the right edge"
    expected: >
      The actor name truncates via numberOfLines={1} and the icons remain
      fully visible with their increased size. The marginLeft on actorActions
      ensures minimum spacing from the name text.

  - id: EC-2
    case: "Screen is narrow (small phone)"
    expected: >
      The icons and gap should still fit comfortably within the row. The total
      width of the actions area (28px icon + 8px padding x2 per icon + 28px gap)
      is approximately 100px, which is well within any supported screen width.

files_likely_impacted:
  - path: "src/components/ActorSelector.tsx"
    action: "MODIFY"
    details: >
      1. Change `actionIcon.fontSize` from 24 to 28.
      2. Change `actionIcon.padding` from 4 to 8.
      3. Change `actorActions.gap` from 20 to 28.
      4. Change `hitSlop` prop on both Pressable components from 12 to 16.

    description: >
      The size increase values (fontSize 24->28, padding 4->8, gap 20->28,
      hitSlop 12->16) are reasonable increments that improve usability without
      making the icons disproportionately large relative to the actor row.
    confirmed: false
    default_if_not_confirmed: >
      Use the proposed values. They can be fine-tuned after visual review.
