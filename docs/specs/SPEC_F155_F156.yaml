execution_order: "F155 first (theme changes), then F156 (depends on new color tokens from F155)"
execution_rationale: >
  F155 modifies lightColors in theme.ts, changing background, surface, card,
  border, divider, input and toggle track colors to a bluish palette. F156
  modifies ReadOnlySpeakerRow in AgendaForm.tsx to add italic + reduced-contrast
  color to speaker names and change the disabled 2nd speech placeholder label.
  F156 uses colors.textSecondary for the reduced color, which is already a
  semantic token unaffected by F155's palette changes. However, F155 should
  land first so the visual result of F156 can be validated with the final
  light theme palette.

      CR-218 requests improving the overall contrast of the light theme by
      adopting bluish tones, similar to what the dark theme already uses.
      The key issues are:

      1. CARD VS BACKGROUND: lightColors.card (#FFFFFF) is IDENTICAL to
         lightColors.background (#FFFFFF), producing zero visual separation
         between cards and the page background.
      2. NEUTRAL GRAYS: Current surface tones (#F8F9FA, #F0F1F3, #D1D5DB)
         are pure neutral grays with no bluish character, while the dark theme
         uses a consistent Slate/blue-gray palette (#0F172A, #1E293B, #334155).
      3. TOGGLES: Switch trackColor uses colors.border (currently #D1D5DB)
         for the false/off state. This should also adopt the bluish palette.

      DESIRED STATE: The light theme should use a bluish-tinted palette that:
      - Creates clear visual separation between cards (#FFFFFF) and background
      - Uses Slate-based blue-gray tones for surfaces, borders, and dividers
      - Matches the bluish character of the dark theme
      - Maintains WCAG AA contrast ratios for text

      APPROACH: Update lightColors in src/lib/theme.ts to use Tailwind Slate
      palette values for neutral tones, and change the background from pure
      white to a light Slate tint so cards (staying white) stand out.

      All components use semantic tokens via useTheme(), so only theme.ts
      needs to change. No component files are modified.

      COLOR MAPPING (current -> new):
      - background: #FFFFFF -> #F1F5F9 (Slate-100, light bluish-gray)
      - surface: #F8F9FA -> #E2E8F0 (Slate-200, slightly darker bluish)
      - surfaceVariant: #F0F1F3 -> #CBD5E1 (Slate-300, medium bluish)
      - card: #FFFFFF -> #FFFFFF (unchanged, creates contrast with background)
      - border: #D1D5DB -> #94A3B8 (Slate-400, bluish border)
      - divider: #E5E7EB -> #CBD5E1 (Slate-300, bluish divider)
      - tabBar: #FFFFFF -> #F1F5F9 (matches background for visual continuity)
      - tabBarInactive: #9CA3AF -> #64748B (Slate-500, darker for contrast)
      - inputBackground: #F9FAFB -> #F8FAFC (Slate-50, very light bluish)
      - inputBorder: #D1D5DB -> #94A3B8 (Slate-400, matches border)
      - placeholder: #9CA3AF -> #94A3B8 (Slate-400, bluish placeholder)

      TEXT COLORS (unchanged - already have good contrast):
      - text: #1A1A1A (16.6:1 on white, 14.1:1 on Slate-100)
      - textSecondary: #5A5A5A (7.0:1 on white, 6.0:1 on Slate-100)
      - textTertiary: #8A8A8A (3.5:1 on white, 3.0:1 on Slate-100)
      - textInverse: #FFFFFF (unchanged)

      PRIMARY/STATUS COLORS (unchanged):
      - primary: #2563EB (already bluish, fits the new palette)
      - primaryContainer: #DBEAFE (already bluish)
      - onPrimary: #FFFFFF
      - error/success/warning: unchanged (semantic colors)

      CONTRAST VERIFICATION (new palette):
      - text #1A1A1A on background #F1F5F9: ratio 14.1:1 (AA pass)
      - text #1A1A1A on card #FFFFFF: ratio 16.6:1 (AA pass)
      - textSecondary #5A5A5A on card #FFFFFF: ratio 7.0:1 (AA pass)
      - textSecondary #5A5A5A on background #F1F5F9: ratio 6.0:1 (AA pass)
      - textTertiary #8A8A8A on card #FFFFFF: ratio 3.5:1 (AA large text pass)
      - card #FFFFFF vs background #F1F5F9: visible separation (1.08:1 luminance)
      - border #94A3B8 on card #FFFFFF: ratio 2.8:1 (decorative, OK)

          Key change is background from #FFFFFF to #F1F5F9 so white cards pop.
          All neutral tones shift to Slate equivalents for consistent bluish feel.
          Text colors stay the same to preserve WCAG AA compliance.

# F156: Speaker fields rework in agenda editing card (CR-220)
# =============================================================================

  - id: F156
    name: "Rework speaker fields in agenda editing card with italic and reduced color"
    cr_id: 220
    type: ui_improvement
    supersedes_partially: [F149]
    related_crs: [213, 214]
    related_features: [F149, F150, F132]
    description: >
      CR-220 is a rework of CR-213 (F149). The user reports that CR-213 was
      poorly implemented: the disabled visual (opacity: 0.5 + surfaceVariant
      background) is too heavy-handed. Instead, the speaker name text in the
      agenda editing card should use a more subtle approach:

      1. ITALIC TEXT: Speaker names in ReadOnlySpeakerRow should be displayed
         in italic (fontStyle: 'italic') to distinguish them from editable fields.
      2. REDUCED COLOR: Speaker names should use colors.textSecondary instead
         of colors.text, reducing the contrast to make them visually secondary.
      3. DISABLED 2ND SPEECH LABEL: When the 2nd speech is disabled, the
         placeholder label should change from the current behavior (showing
         "2o Discursante" as placeholder) to show a specific message:
         "Domingo ajustado para nao ter 2o discurso". The i18n key
         speeches.secondSpeechDisabledPlaceholder currently uses the word
         "configurado" but the user wants "ajustado" instead.
      4. SCOPE: These changes apply ONLY to ReadOnlySpeakerRow in AgendaForm.tsx
         (agenda editing cards). SpeechSlot.tsx (speech editing cards) MUST NOT
         be modified.

      CURRENT STATE (after F149/CR-213):
      - ReadOnlySpeakerRow in AgendaForm.tsx:692-725
      - Speaker name text: fontSize 15, no fontStyle, color = colors.text
         (full contrast)
      - Disabled state: opacity: 0.5 + backgroundColor: colors.surfaceVariant
         (heavy visual treatment)
      - 2nd speech disabled: speakerName is '' so label ("2o Discursante")
         shows as placeholder (line 715: {speakerName || label})

      DESIRED STATE:
      - Speaker name text: fontSize 15, fontStyle: 'italic', color =
         colors.textSecondary (for speaker names; placeholder keeps textTertiary)
      - Disabled state (2nd speech off, observer): keep the existing F149
         disabled visual (opacity: 0.5 + surfaceVariant background) AS-IS.
         The italic + reduced color is for ALL speaker rows, not just disabled.
      - 2nd speech disabled: the placeholder text (when speakerName is empty)
         should be t('speeches.secondSpeechDisabledPlaceholder') which reads
         "Domingo ajustado para nao ter 2o discurso" (note: "ajustado" not
         "configurado").

      IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES:
      1. In ReadOnlySpeakerRow (AgendaForm.tsx:708-712), change the text style:
         - Add fontStyle: 'italic' to speakerReadText when speakerName is present
         - Change color from colors.text to colors.textSecondary when speakerName
           is present
         - When speakerName is empty (placeholder), keep color as
           colors.textTertiary (existing behavior)
      2. In the 2nd speaker ReadOnlySpeakerRow call (AgendaForm.tsx:422-430),
         change speakerName when disabled to show the disabled placeholder:
         - When has_second_speech === false: speakerName should be
           t('speeches.secondSpeechDisabledPlaceholder') instead of ''
      3. Update i18n: change "configurado" to "ajustado" in pt-BR,
         "configured" to "adjusted" in en, "configurado" to "ajustado" in es
         for the speeches.secondSpeechDisabledPlaceholder key.
      4. In ReadOnlySpeakerRow, add a new prop or logic so the disabled
         placeholder text also gets italic + textSecondary styling (since it
         will be a non-empty speakerName string).

      IMPORTANT: The disabled visual from F149 (opacity: 0.5 + surfaceVariant
      background on the row when disabled=true) is KEPT. The italic + reduced
      color changes are ADDITIONAL and apply to ALL ReadOnlySpeakerRow
      instances (both enabled and disabled).

          When 2nd speech is disabled, show the disabled placeholder message
          instead of empty string. This makes the speakerName truthy, so
          ReadOnlySpeakerRow will render it with italic + textSecondary styling
          rather than showing the generic label as placeholder.

        F155 uses Tailwind CSS Slate palette values for the light theme bluish
        tones. These are the same family of colors used in the dark theme
        (#0F172A = Slate-900, #1E293B = Slate-800, #334155 = Slate-700),
        creating visual consistency between themes. The specific Slate values
        chosen (100, 200, 300, 400, 500) maintain adequate contrast ratios
        while shifting the neutral palette from pure gray to blue-gray.

    - id: A-02
      text: >
        For F155, the approach of changing background from white (#FFFFFF) to
        Slate-100 (#F1F5F9) while keeping card as white creates the card-vs-
        background contrast requested. This is the minimal change that achieves
        the goal. An alternative approach (making card off-white and background
        darker) was rejected because it would reduce text contrast ratios on
        the card surface.

      text: >
        For F156, the italic + textSecondary styling applies to ALL 3 speaker
        ReadOnlySpeakerRow instances (positions 1, 2, 3), not just the disabled
        2nd speaker. The CR text says "campos de discursante no card de edicao
        de agenda com italico + cor reduzida" (speaker fields in the agenda
        editing card with italic + reduced color), which applies to all of them.

    - id: A-04
      text: >
        For F156, the F149 disabled visual (opacity: 0.5 + surfaceVariant
        background) is preserved on the row container. The italic + reduced
        color applies to the TEXT inside the row. Both effects coexist: the
        disabled row is dimmed AND the text inside uses italic + reduced color.

    - id: A-05
      text: >
        For F156, the secondSpeechDisabledPlaceholder text is passed as
        speakerName (non-empty string), so ReadOnlySpeakerRow renders it
        with italic + textSecondary styling. This is the intended visual:
        the disabled message looks like a speaker name in terms of styling
        (italic, reduced color) but the content explains why the field is
        disabled.

    - id: A-06
      text: >
        For F156, the word change from "configurado" to "ajustado" in the
        i18n key affects ALL 3 languages. In pt-BR and es, "ajustado" is the
        direct translation. In en, "adjusted" replaces "configured". This
        change also affects any other place that uses this i18n key, but
        per codebase analysis, the key is only used in the 2nd speech context.
