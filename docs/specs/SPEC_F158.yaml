  9 CRs grouped into a single feature (F158). All are UI adjustments to the
  managed prayers feature (F157/CR-221). Recommended implementation order:
  (1) CR-230 bugfix (double label in AgendaForm),
  (2) CR-222 add StatusLED circles to prayer lines in collapsed card,
  (3) CR-223 hide prayer label when no name assigned,
  (4) CR-227 add spacing gap after exception text in testimony/primary cards,
  (5) CR-228 reduce line spacing in collapsed cards,
  (6) CR-229 uniform card height for all card types,
  (7) CR-225 pass managePrayers to NextSundaysSection SundayCard,
  (8) CR-224 rename toggle + reorder + add description text,
  (9) CR-226 multiline tab label for Speeches & Prayers tab.
execution_rationale: >
  CR-230 is a bugfix (double label) that should land first for correctness.
  CRs 222/223/227/228/229 are all SundayCard collapsed layout adjustments
  that build on each other - StatusLED circles (222), conditional label (223),
  spacing (227), reduced margins (228), and uniform height (229). CR-225 is a
  data-plumbing fix for the Home tab. CR-224 is a settings UI change. CR-226
  is a standalone tab layout change.

      assigned, (3) renaming the manage_prayers toggle and adding a description,
      (4) passing managePrayers prop to NextSundaysSection, (5) allowing the
      Speeches & Prayers tab label to wrap to 2 lines, (6) adding spacing
      between exception text and prayer lines in testimony/primary cards,
      (7) reducing vertical spacing between lines in collapsed cards,
      (8) making all collapsed cards the same height, (9) fixing a double-label
      bug in AgendaForm when managePrayers is on.

        description: "Collapsed card layout adjustments"
        details: |
          CR-222: Add StatusLED to prayer lines in collapsed card.
          - For prayer lines (positions 0 and 4), add <StatusLED status={prayerStatus}
            size={10} /> before the prayer text in the speechRow View.
          - Get prayer status from the speech record: speech?.status ?? 'not_assigned'.
          - Applies to both isSpeechesType and isTestimonyOrPrimary branches.

          CR-223: Conditionally hide prayer prefix label.
          - Change prayer text from always showing '{prayerPrefix} {name}' to:
            - If name is present: show '{prayerPrefix} {name}' in italic
            - If name is empty/null: show empty space (no text, just StatusLED)
          - The line still occupies vertical space (empty Text with ' ').

          CR-227: Add marginTop spacing after exception text in testimony/primary.
          - In the isTestimonyOrPrimary branch, add marginTop (e.g., 6px) to the
            first prayer View after the exception text. This creates a visual gap.

          CR-228: Reduce marginBottom on speechRow style.
          - Change speechRow marginBottom from 4 to 1 (or 2).
          - This applies globally to all collapsed card lines.

          CR-229: Add minHeight to headerCenter for uniform card height.
          - When collapsed, set minHeight on headerCenter View to accommodate
            the maximum number of lines for the current manage_prayers state.
          - manage_prayers = true: 5 lines height
          - manage_prayers = false: 3 lines height (existing F151/CR-215 behavior)
          - Calculation based on: N lines * lineHeight + (N-1) * marginBottom.
          - This replaces the existing F151 minHeight: 62 logic with a dynamic value.

        description: "Fix double label bug in prayer fields"
        details: |
          The bug: when manage_prayers = true, the opening/closing prayer fields

            </FieldRow>
          ReadOnlySpeakerRow internally renders its own FieldRow with the same
          label, producing:
            FieldRow("Oracao de Abertura")
              FieldRow("Oracao de Abertura")  <-- double label
                speakerReadRow

          Fix: For the prayer-specific manage_prayers=true branch, render the
          speaker read-only View directly without the ReadOnlySpeakerRow wrapper,
          or pass a flag to ReadOnlySpeakerRow to skip its internal FieldRow.

          Approach: Replace the ReadOnlySpeakerRow call inside the prayer FieldRow
          with direct rendering of the speakerReadRow content (View with Text and
          PencilIcon), since the parent FieldRow already provides the label.

          1. Move the managePrayers toggle from last position (L246-257) to
             2nd position in the Ward Settings group, right after the Members item.
          2. Update the toggle label from t('settings.managePrayers') which uses
             the new i18n key value 'Usar Convites para Oracoes'.
          3. Add a description Text below the label, using the new i18n key
             t('settings.managePrayersDescription').
          4. The toggle item becomes a multi-line item with label + description
             on the left and Switch on the right.

          Add tabBarLabelStyle to the Tabs screenOptions (or specifically to
          the speeches tab) to allow text wrapping:
            tabBarLabelStyle: { textAlign: 'center' }
          And/or set the tab options with a custom tabBarLabel render function
          that allows numberOfLines={2} on the Text component.

        CR-228 reduces marginBottom from 4 to 1 (or 2). The exact value
        should be validated visually. The spec uses 1px as the target but
        the implementor should adjust to the value that looks best on device.

        CR-229 uniform card height is achieved via minHeight on headerCenter.
        This extends the existing F151/CR-215 approach. The minHeight value
        is calculated as: numberOfLines * lineHeight + (numberOfLines - 1) *
        newMarginBottom. When manage_prayers = true, numberOfLines = 5; when
        false, numberOfLines = 3.

    - id: A-03

        CR-230 fix for double label uses direct rendering of the speaker
        read-only content inside the prayer FieldRow, rather than modifying
        ReadOnlySpeakerRow itself. This avoids regressions in the speech
        fields (positions 1, 2, 3) that call ReadOnlySpeakerRow directly
        (not wrapped in a parent FieldRow).

        CR-224 reorder places the manage_prayers toggle as the 2nd item
        only when the user is Bispado. For other roles, the toggle is not
        visible at all (existing behavior). The items above the toggle
        (Members) must also be Bispado-visible for the ordering to be
        correct. Since Members is visible to both Bispado and Secretario
        (via hasPermission('member:read')), the toggle appears after Members
        for Bispado and is simply not rendered for other roles.

        CR-226 multiline tab label may require adjusting the tab bar height
        slightly. The exact styling depends on the Expo Router/React Navigation
        tab bar implementation. A tabBarLabelStyle with fontSize and lineHeight
        adjustments may be needed to fit 2 lines cleanly.
